# ml_unet_implementation
This repository contains the code for my project in the Advanced Topics in Machine Learning course, where I have implemented the U-Net architecture.

Dataset Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YiU8rFyePAHl6B_xyXCuq0XbOlJ3fkjv/view?usp=share_link

I have used Google Colab to build the project. 

Steps to run the project:
1. Upload the .ipynb file to google colab.
2. Download the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YiU8rFyePAHl6B_xyXCuq0XbOlJ3fkjv/view?usp=share_link). You can either upload it directly into the colab or on the google drive and add the path/link of the dataset to `zip_file_path` variable. If you have uploaded the zipped file on the google drive mount google drive or else it is not needed.
